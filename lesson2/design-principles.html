            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p class="boldname">WeTransfer</p>
            <p><a href="https://wetransfer.com/" target="_blank">wetransfer.com</a></p>

            <p>Hick's Law, in a nutshell, says that the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of
                options increases. This makes sense as a general rule, think of the last time you went to a restaurant
                which had a full menu and they asked if you were ready to order, you probably needed some more time,
                right? WeTransfer has used this design rule to their advantage. When you get there, you immediately see
                their main option (which is to transfer a file). Next you see two other options, one to go "Pro", the
                next to get the Collect app. That is pretty much it, unless you open the menu. Wonderfully executed,
                with little need for thought. I mean, who has time for unnecessary options in this day and age? </p>

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <p class="boldname">Netflix</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/za/" target="_blank">netflix.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/netflix-screenshot.png">
            <p>Fitt's Law, summarized, says that the amount of time it takes for a person to move a pointer/mouse cursor
                to the target area, and the size of said target area, determines the time it takes to click it.
                Basically, the longer the distance to and the smaller the target area, the longer it takes or the harder
                it is to click. I could have used WeTransfer here as well; see that large, single, centered "Send a
                file" button? That is right in the path the mobile user will take while browsing, and it has no other
                buttons in the way making it easy to click. However, another company that uses this tool quite well is
                Netflix. Their "Get Started" button is large and right at the top where you would start browsing, making
                it easy to "Get Started".</p>

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <p class="subheading1">...and Clean Design</p>
            <p class="boldname">Mikyna Point Restaurant</p>
            <p><a href="https://mikynapoint.cz/en/" target="_blank">mikynapoint.cz/en/</a></p>
            <img src="images/mikynapoint-screenshot.png">
            <p>For web design, white space (sometimes known as negative space) is the space between images, text and
                other content/elements on the website. Clean design uses white space correctly to make the most
                important things stand out and to minimize distractions. People are drawn to this, especially since we
                are now online a lot more than in previous years. We seek simplicity, and the combination of these three
                tools will result in success! I came across this lovely website with great use of white space and clean
                design, it was designed for the Mikyna Point Restaurant in the Czech Republic. Each section has its own
                space, navigating it is a pleasure with minimal distractions. Each page or section gives you only the
                information you require. Beautiful!</p>
